# 5e Complete
The full D&amp;D 5th Edition compendium for Foundry VTT.

This module was designed to fill in the holes of the 5e SRD that's included with Foundry, including all of the official classes and their subclasses, spells, races, and so on.

A special thanks goes to my friends that have helped get this compendium to where it is, and also a big thank you to [Zhell](https://github.com/krbz999?tab=repositories) for helping with the macros.

# Disclaimers
- Please only utilize the resources in this module that you personally own. Treat this as you would downloading a video game ROM and respect the copyright of Wizards of the Coast.
- This is a work in progress; many class features, spells, races, backgrounds, and feats are still missing.
- The creatures have image references that you won't have, and I can't think of a way around that. Sorry.

# Dependencies
5e Complete should work out of the box without any other modules. That said, the following modules are recommended for QoL improvements:
- Dynamic Active Effects
- Item Macro
- Magic Items
- Roll Groups
- Tidy5e Sheet
- Wild Magic Surge 5e
